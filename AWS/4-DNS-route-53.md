# Managed DNS

Route 53 offering.

In this repo, I gave 2 example of route 53 managed DNS usage:

- [Make your tld ns record point to a nameserver of your choice (AWS route 53)](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/2-advanced-bind/5-real-own-dns-application/2-modify-tld-ns-record.md),
- [Delegate a subdomain (to another DNS nameserver)](https://github.com/scoulomb/myDNS/blob/master/2-advanced-bind/5-real-own-dns-application/5-delegate-subzone.md)

We could also buy domain at Amazon (not tested)
